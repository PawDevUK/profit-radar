## 2. Pricing Strategy

### 2.1 Pricing Model Rationale

**Customer Perspective**:

```
Current cost of importing 1 car:
- Manual research/calculation time: 3 hours × $25/hr = $75
- Missed opportunities (estimated): $200-500 per month
- Wrong decisions (average loss): $300-800 per car

ProfitRadar value:
- Saves 2.5 hours/day × 20 days = 50 hours/month = $1,250
- Improves deal selection: +$2,000-5,000/month profit
- Reduces bad deals: Saves $1,000+ per bad decision avoided

ROI: For $9.99/month user, saves $1,200+/month = 120x ROI

   and improves profit margins by 5-10%?"

Responses:
- Individual importers (1-5 cars/month): 
  "Free - $10/month" (40%)
  "$10-30/month" (35%)
  "$30-100/month" (15%)
  "$100+/month" (10%)

- Small dealers (10-50 cars/month):
  "$30-100/month" (20%)
  "$100-300/month" (45%)
  "$300-1000/month" (25%)
  "$1000+/month" (10%)

- Medium dealers (50-200 cars/month):
  "$300-1000/month" (25%)
  "$1000-5000/month" (50%)
  "$5000+/month" (25%)
